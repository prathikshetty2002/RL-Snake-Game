# Snakezy
A reinforcement learning AI agent based game 
This is a snake game that is build on the Reinforcement Learning model. It uses a reward-based structure to make the agent improve it's performance as well as accuracy.
Online resources about pygame and reinforcement learning were a great help in learning the concepts.
Here are some links to learn reinforcement learning :  https://youtu.be/Mut_u40Sqz4
The guidance for the project was taken from open source resources. I will try to improve it in future! &lt;3
